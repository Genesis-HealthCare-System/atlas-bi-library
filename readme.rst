Atlas BI Library
================

Atlas BI Library is a business intelligence library and documentation database. ETL processes collect metadata from various reporting platforms and store it in a centrally located database. A modern web UI is used to add additional documentation to the report objects and also to provide an intuitive way to search, favorite and share reporting content.
